## About Me

My name is Austin, and I'm a passionate Software Developer at Travelers, where I specialize in developing cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence applications. With a strong foundation in full-stack development and a deep interest in robotics, I bring innovative solutions to complex challenges.

### What I Do

I focus on building intelligent systems that make a difference. My expertise spans across:

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Developing and deploying AI models that solve real-world problems
- **Full-Stack Development**: Creating seamless experiences from backend architecture to frontend interfaces  
- **Cloud Solutions**: Leveraging cloud platforms to build scalable, reliable applications
- **Robotics**: Exploring the intersection of software and hardware to create autonomous systems

### My Approach

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, architecting cloud infrastructure, or designing intuitive user interfaces, I approach each challenge with curiosity and precision.
