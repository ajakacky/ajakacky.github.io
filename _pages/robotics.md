## Robotics Projects & Exploration

Robotics represents the perfect intersection of software, hardware, and artificial intelligence. This section showcases my journey in building autonomous systems, exploring embedded programming, and experimenting with the physical manifestation of code.

### Areas of Focus

**Autonomous Systems**  
Developing intelligent robots that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute tasks without human intervention.

**Embedded Programming**  
Working with microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators to create responsive hardware systems.

**Computer Vision**  
Implementing visual perception systems that allow robots to understand and interact with their surroundings.

**Motion Planning & Control**  
Designing algorithms for efficient and safe robot movement in complex environments.
