## Professional Background

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and innovative technology solutions. Currently, I work at Travelers, where I develop and maintain AI-powered applications that streamline complex processes and enhance decision-making capabilities.

### My Journey

My journey into software development began with a fascination for how computers think and solve problems. This curiosity led me to explore various domains:

**Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
I specialize in building intelligent systems using modern frameworks and cloud platforms. From natural language processing to computer vision, I enjoy tackling challenges that push the boundaries of what machines can do.

**Full-Stack Development**  
With experience across the entire development stack, I create cohesive applications that are both powerful and user-friendly. My toolkit includes Python, JavaScript, cloud technologies, and modern web frameworks.

**Robotics & Hardware Integration**  
Beyond pure software, I have a deep interest in robotics and embedded systems. Combining software intelligence with physical hardware opens up exciting possibilities for automation and innovation.

### Technical Expertise

**Languages & Frameworks:**  
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Flask, Django

**AI/ML Technologies:**  
TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, AWS SageMaker, OpenCV

**Cloud & Infrastructure:**
